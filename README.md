# GPS My Self

## What is this? 
This is mostly a collection of prototypes developed to prove/show the possible advantages of using sound waves instead of electro-magnetic waves for locating positions.  

## Motivation
This project is a school project intended as a final project for our Physics/CompSci class

## Basic Theorem
Sound waves travel at 343m/s in regular air, compared to the ca. 300,000,000 m/s of light/electro-magnetic waves that is a decrease in speed by around 1,000,000x
The logical concept we grasped from that information is, that if we want to be able to pinpoint a location using sound waves instead of electro-magnetic waves we can reach 1,000,000 times more accurate positions when using the same sampling rate

## State of development
This repository is just meant as a memory and there wont be further development on here, but in case anyone is interested here are some of our thought processes :)
